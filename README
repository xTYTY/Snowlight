SNOWLIGHT, HABBO HOTEL EMULATOR

This is the development repository for Snowlight, an open-source Habbo
Hotel emulator written in C#.

The source code was originally developed as propietary software, but as of
30/07/2011 we have decided to release the source code publicly. We kindly
invite any interested parties to help contribute towards this software's
development.

The project files are in Visual Studio 2010 format and some functions may
rely on .NET Framework 4.0. Most of the code should run natively on Mono,
although this is officially unsupported.

The project will remain to be actively maintained and supported.

If you use any portion(s) of the source code, please remember to do so
under the terms of the license (see 'LICENSE' file in repository root).

We would like to work towards one high-quality server rather than a
wide array of lower-quality releases. Please submit patches or
otherwise contribute to the official project rather than spawning
your own, unless you plan to make significant changes that cannot be
implemented in the official build. See RetroDev for more information on
how to contribute to the project.

We would like to extend our thanks to all contributers and supporters
of this project.
